`nw_ptcl` makes use of the [NintendoWareForCafe Eft](https://github.com/nsmbu/Eft) library.  
Nintendo copied the source code to here as part of `nw_ptcl`, instead of linking the pre-built binary that comes as part of NintendoWareForCafe.  

# Dependencies
[NintendoWareForCafe Sys](https://github.com/nsmbu/Sys) library.  
Unlike with `Eft`, Nintendo did not copy the source code of `Sys` to here. Instead, the pre-built binary that comes as part of NintendoWareForCafe is linked.
